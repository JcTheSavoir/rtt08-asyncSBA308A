Project Title: SBA 308A JavaScript Web Application
Project requirements:

-- Objectives
Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
Organize files using modules and imports.

-- Instructions
* You will create a small single-page web application.
* Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. 
* You will need access to an external API in order to complete the requirements listed below. Since the content of the API will largely determine the content of your application, it should be chosen first and carefully. You can look for available APIs across the internet, but make sure they include features that will allow you to implement the requirements listed below.
